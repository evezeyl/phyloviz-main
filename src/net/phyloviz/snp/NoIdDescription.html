    The dataset type Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) (without explicit
    ID) is designed to analyze SNP data based on the presence and absence of
    a SNP, and no explicit ID was attributed to the entire SNP profile.<br> 
    The sequences need to be all of the same size. Sequences of different
    sizes will be excluded.
