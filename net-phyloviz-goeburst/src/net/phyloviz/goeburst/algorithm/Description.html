This distance builds upon the rules defined in the article by Feil <i>et al</i> to select if a link should be drawn.
In order to provide an unique minimum spanning tree(MST) like structure, this option can also expand goeBURST rules 
to the number of loci used in a typing schema.
<br/>
<br/>
Let n be the number of differences, which is always less than the number of loci.
The implemented rules are (by order):
<ul>
  <li><b>1</b>: #SLVs</li>
  <li><b>2</b>: #DLVs</li>
  <li><b>3</b>: #TLVs</li>
  <li><b>4 to n</b>: #(4 to n)LVs</li>
  <li><b>n+1</b>: Frequency of an ST</li>
  <li><b>n+2</b>: STID</li>
</ul>
The last rule was added in goeBURST to ensure that the represented tree is unique. 
This rule is that the lower ST id should be selected in case of tie at this level.
