If you have any type of ancillary data about the isolates (Demographic
information, Epidemiological information, Antibiotic Resistance, Gene
presence absence,etc) you can load a tab separated file to further
represent it on the algorithm. This file should be a tab separated
file with the first row with column headers (field names). One of the
fields should be the Sequence identifier. Choose this field in the Key
drop down menu to link the ancillary data to the allelic profile data.
If the field does not appear in the drop down menu press the Update
button. If you don't have any available data or don't wish do load any
