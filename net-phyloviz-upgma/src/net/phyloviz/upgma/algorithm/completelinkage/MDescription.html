        <p> <b>CL</b> (<b>C</b>omplete - <b>L</b>inkage) is a simple <b>agglomerative</b> (bottom-up) <b>hierarchical</b> clustering method. 
        It is also known as <b>farthest neighbour clustering</b></p>
        
        <p> CL is used for the creation of <b>phenetic trees</b> (phenograms) and in a phylogenetic context, it assumes a constant rate of evolution
        (molecular clock hypothesis), and is not a well-regarded method for inferring relationships unless this assumption has been tested and justified 
        for the data set being used. </p>
        
        <p> This algorithm constructs a <b>rooted tree</b> (dendrogram) that reflects the structure present in a pairwise <b>dissimilarity matrix</b>.
        At each step, the nearest two clusters are combined into a higher-level cluster. The <b>distance</b> between any two clusters <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> is 
        the <b>farthest</b> distance between elements of each cluster.</p>

        <p> The method is attributed to <b>D. Defays</b>. </p>
