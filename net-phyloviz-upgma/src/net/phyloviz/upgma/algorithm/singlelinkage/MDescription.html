        <p> <b>SL</b> (<b>S</b>ingle - <b>L</b>inkage) is a simple <b>agglomerative</b> (bottom-up) <b>hierarchical</b> clustering method. 
            It is also known as <b>nearest neighbour clustering</b></p>

        <p> SL is used for the creation of <b>phenetic trees</b> (phenograms) and in a phylogenetic context, it assumes a constant rate of evolution
            (molecular clock hypothesis), and is not a well-regarded method for inferring relationships unless this assumption has been tested and justified 
            for the data set being used. </p>

        <p> This algorithm constructs a <b>rooted tree</b> (dendrogram) that reflects the structure present in a pairwise <b>dissimilarity matrix</b>.
            At each step, the nearest two clusters are combined into a higher-level cluster. The <b>distance</b> between any two clusters <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> is 
            the <b>shortest</b> distance between elements of each cluster.</p>

        <p> The method is attributed to <b>R. Sibson</b>. </p>
