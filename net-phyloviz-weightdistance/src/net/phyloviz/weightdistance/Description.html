This distance adds a first tiebreak rule to the goeBURST rules based on the Euclidean distance between two profiles.
It assumes that the genetic distance between two MLVA profiles is proportional to the difference in the number of 
repeats at each locus. NEW
<br/>
<br/>
For goeBURST algorithm, it will still link only two Sequence Types only if they are SLVs.
<br/>
<br/>
The complete list of rules used to create the trees are:
<ul>
  <li><b>1</b>: Euclidean distance between profiles</li>
  <li><b>2</b>: #SLVs</li>
  <li><b>3</b>: #DLVs</li>
  <li><b>4</b>: #TLVs</li>
  <li><b>5 to (n+1)</b>: #(4 to n)LVs</li>
  <li><b>n+2</b>: Frequency of an ST</li>
  <li><b>n+3</b>: STID</li>
</ul>
