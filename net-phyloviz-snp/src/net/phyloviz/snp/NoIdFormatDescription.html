    The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) (without explicit ID)  Dataset
    type was chosen. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The data format for the typing data should be as follows.
    Load a tab separated file with the first row containing column headers
    i.e. SNP identifiers.
    On each column should be the different SNP values. For each SNP the
    value can be either 0/1 for absence/presence or the actual nucleotide
    found (A/T/G/C).                                                
    A unique sequential ID identifier will be attributed to each SNP profile
    based on the order of the profiles in the file.

    An example of the file content for absence/presence of a given snp
    follows:<br>
<pre>
    snp1  snp2  snp3  snp4  snp5                      
    0     1     0     1     1
    0     1     1     1     1
    0     1     1     0     1
    1     1     1     0     1
    1     1     1     1     1
