    The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Dataset type was chosen. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The data format for the typing data should be as follows.         
    Load a tab separated file with the first row containing column headers
    (field names). The first field name should be ID and the following the
    SNP position identifiers.
    The first column should be a Sequence Identifier, an unique ID for the
    complete SNP profile. Other columns should be the different SNP values.
    For each SNP the value can be either 0/1 for absence/presence or the   
    actual nucleotide found (A/T/G/C).
    <br/>                             
    <br/>                             
    An example of the file content for absence/presence of a given SNP
    follows:
<pre>
    ID  snp1  snp2  snp3   snp4  snp5
    1   0     1     0      1     1
    2   0     1     1      1     1
    3   0     1     1      0     1
    4   1     1     1      0     1
    5   1     1     1      1     1
    6   0     0     1      1     1
</pre>
    This files should not contain missing data. If any SNP position is
    missing data, the entire line will be discarded.
