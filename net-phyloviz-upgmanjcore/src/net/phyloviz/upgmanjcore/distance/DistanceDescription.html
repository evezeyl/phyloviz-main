        <p> In information theory, the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. In another way, it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other, or the minimum number of errors that could have transformed one string into the other. </p>
        
        <p>This distance is used as a measure of genetic distance.</p>
        
        <p>The Hamming distance is named after <b>Richard W. Hamming</b> </p>
