Please choose the desired parameters.
The simulation will consider fixed-size populations with non-overlapping generations.
Every allele of each individual has independent probabilities of <i>mutation</i> and <i>recombination</i>.

At the end of the simulation, only the last <i>sampled</i> generations will be
included in the dataset.<br/>
