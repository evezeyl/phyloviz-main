    The MLVA Dataset type was chosen. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The data format for the typing data should be as follows.                                         
    Load a tab separated file with the first row containing column headers
    (field names). The first column should be a Sequence Identifier, an   
    unique ID for the complete allelic profile.<br> Other columns should be
    the different loci used in the typing scheme. For each loci the number
    of repeats found should be given.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The following example represents an MLVA scheme with 7 loci named <code>l1</code> to
    <code>l7</code>:
<pre>
  ST      l1     l2      l3      l4      l5      l6     l7
  1       8      6       6       6       12      13     4
  2       5      4.5     4       2.5     2       15     2
  3       5.5    3       4       1.5     6       8      4                
  (...)
</pre>
    This files should not contain missing data. If any allele missing data
    is found the entire line is discarded.
